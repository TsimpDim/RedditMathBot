You can summon the bot easily by including  '!RedditMathBot|\<function\>: \<arguments\>' in your comment.

The available functions and their corresponding arguments are : 
* Solve: [\<expression\>,\<variable\>]

Examples : 

1. Hey @alex, whatsup @brian @mary !RedditMathBot|Limit: [x,x,oo] cool photo !RedditMathBot|Solve: [a + w + d,a] so that then you do !RedditMathBot|Diff: [x**2,x,1]but wait how does that work? Lets check !RedditMathBot|Help .!RedditMathBot|Solve: [2*x,x]

* Solution : [-d - w] 
* Solution : [0]
* The derivative is : 2*x
* The limit is : oo

2. !RedditMathBot|Help 
!RedditMathBot|Solve: [3*x - 1,x]

* Solution : [1/3]
