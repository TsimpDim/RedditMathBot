## RedditMathBot 

NOTICE: This bot is not in use! I made it as a fun side project, it works but you cannot call it

You can summon the bot easily by including  '!RedditMathBot|\<function\>: \<arguments\>' in your comment.

The available functions and their corresponding arguments are : 
* Solve: [\<expression\>,\<variable\>]
* Diff: [\<expression\>,\<variable\>,\<times_to_diff\>]
* Limit: [\<expression\>,\<variable\>,\<approaching_value\>]

Examples : 

1. Hey @alex, whatsup @brian @mary !RedditMathBot|Limit: [x,x,oo] cool photo !RedditMathBot|Solve: [a + w + d,a] so that then you do !RedditMathBot|Diff: [x**2,x,1]but wait how does that work? Lets check !RedditMathBot|Help .!RedditMathBot|Solve: [2*x,x]

* Solution to 'a + w + d': [-d - w]
* Solution to '2\*x': [0]
* The derivative of 'x\*\*2' ,1 time(s) is : 2\*x
* The limit of 'x (x->oo)' is : oo
* \<help message\>

2. !RedditMathBot|Help 
!RedditMathBot|Solve: [3\*x - 1,x]

* Solution to '3\*x - 1': [1/3]
* \<help message\>

3. !RedditMathBot|Limit: [sin(x) + cos(x)/sqrt(2\*x2),x,pi]
* The limit of 'sin(x) + cos(x)/sqrt(2\*\*x\*2) (x->pi' is : -sqrt(2)\*2\*\*(-pi/2)/2
